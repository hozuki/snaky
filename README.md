# Snaky

An experimental project. Creates a DSL and its VS Code extension for [Arcaea](https://arcaea.lowiro.com/).

Goals:

1. Learn to create VS Code extensions (language and general extension).
2. Verify [BVSP](https://github.com/hozuki/beatmap-visualization-server-protocol)'s design on different languages (editor: JavaScript; simulator: C#) and another kind of beatmap.
3. DSL design and verification in JavaScript (similar to [SEBAS](https://github.com/hozuki/sebas)).

*Snaky: "like a snake in appearance; long and sinuous."* Excellent description.
